# Adjust Tab Height
Adjusts tab height by modifying the margin in between tabs. 
* Has one property, where you specify the number of pixels for the margin to be.
  * The browser default is 4 pixels.
  * If you want the tabs to be closer together, you can specify negative numbers. Some things start to break past around -6, but this is not thoroughly tested so there could be other issues.
  * Decimals seem to work fine, although I don't know if they're real or being rounded.
  * Input only the desired number of pixels as a number, do not include a unit.
* This has not been thoroughly tested. It works on my computer, on Windows, with the mods I have and the other css modifications I have (which are minimal). Just making this for my girlfriend so it's easier for her to use and thought others could benefit from it too :)
