# UR Zen

UR Zen centers the URL panel while you’re editing or after clearing the URL. This keeps your focus near the middle of the screen and reduces eye travel.

## What it does
- Centers the URL panel during edits or when the field is empty
- Uses lightweight CSS only (no scripts)
- Minimal, distraction-free effect

## Install
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Import the mod/style in Zen Browser (see Zen’s instructions for installing custom styles).
