## Better Letterboxing

Makes letterboxing look better by rounding the browser corners and adding a slight gradient to the background to make it feel more Tor-like.

Letter boxing is used to make the browser window smaller in order to protect your privacy and make it harder to track you.

The only problem is that Zen Browser doesn't look good with letterboxing enabled. This theme fixes that by making the letterboxing look better. Lettered areas are now rounded and the background uses the accent color to create a gradient effect.

> Note that you need to enable lettterboxing on `about:config` for this to work properly! The key you need to change is `privacy.resistFingerprinting.letterboxing` to `true`.
