# Aura theme for [Zen browser](https://zen-browser.app/).
My personal styles for Zen browser. Search the [Zen Mods store](https://zen-browser.app/mods/) for "Aura" for a one-click install into your browser.

The theme has no preferences, it's just a one-click install that gives you my favorite styles. It is the only Zen Mod I use, so I can't guarantee it will play nicely with other mods.
