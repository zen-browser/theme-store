# Opened Tab Marker for Zen Browser

A simple mod for Zen Browser that visually marks opened tabs with a clear indicator. Zen Browser, by default, does not distinguish between opened and unopened tabs, this mod adds a visible border to all opened tabs, making it easy to see which tabs are active at a glance.

## How It Works

- Opened tabs get a left border (using the current theme color).
- Unopened or loading tabs have no border, keeping the interface clean.
