# Hide Window Buttons

With this theme you can hide the buttons for minimizing, maximizing or closing a window.

You can still perform these actions by pressing Alt + Space.

- For Linux and Windows users, each of these buttons can be hidden separately by changing the configuration in the settings page.
- For macOS users, the three window buttons can't be hidden seperately. Enable the theme in the Look and Feel settings
