# Hide Window Buttons

With this theme you can remove the buttons for minimizing, maximizing or closing a window individually.

You can still perform these actions by pressing Alt + Space.

* Each of these buttons can be disabled separately by changing the configuration in the settings page.
* Disclaimer: this theme may not work on macOS
