# Zen Mod: Extended Scrollbar Alignment

## The Problem

There's a container around the webpage body that shifts the scrollbar slightly to the left and makes it unclickable at the boundary of the monitor.

## Solution

This Zen Mod slightly adjusts the width of the browser window, shifting the scrollbar a bit further to the right. This mod is designed for users who have conditioned themselves to slam their mouse to the right in order to scroll. It didn't work... but zen it does.

## Features

- **Adjustable Body Width**: Customize the body width percentage to position the scrollbar precisely to your liking.
- **Brainless Scrollbar Access**: Ideal for those who prefer to scroll by moving the cursor to the far edge of the screen.

## Customization

You can adjust the body width in **Preferences**:
- **Body Width Percentage**: The default is set to 100.35%. This was the minimum that worked on my monitor. Your monitor may be slightly different.
