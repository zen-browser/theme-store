# Sidebar Expand on Hover

## Description

With this mod the sidebar expands when you hover it. It only works when the browser layout setting is set to collapsed toolbar.

Addionally this mod collapses the buttons below the tabs to provide a smoother experience. Per default your active workspace is shown while the sidebar is collapsed (only works when the workspace switcher is placed there).

## Preferences
- **Hide top workspace indicator**: since the active workspace is already shown below, this theme hides the workspace indicator at the top, if you don't want this: deactivate this setting. *(default: on)*
- **My theme overwrites the #TabsToolbar background (e.g. catppuccin)**: Some themes overwrite the background property of #TabsToolbar (e.g. catppuccin). If you notice some visual issues while the sidebar is expanded due to the use of a theme: try activating this settings and hope that is helps *(default: off)*
- **Collapse the buttons to only show current workspace**: If you don't wish for your buttons to only show your current workspace when collapsed: deactivate this setting and it shows the first button instead when collapsed *(default: on)*
- **Default Tab Background Shape**: When turned on every corner of the tab background is rounded (like in default zen) *(default: off)*
- **Width of the expanded sidebar**: Here you can change the width of the expanded sidebar *(default: 300px)*
- **Transition speed of the sidebar**: Speed of the collapsing/expanding animation *(default: 120ms)*
