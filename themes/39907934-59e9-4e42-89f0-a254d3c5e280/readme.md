# Sidebery

Tweaks to support Sidebery as an alternative to Zen's native tabs and workspace implementation.

### Features
- Hide native Zen Tab controls.
- Transparent browser sidebar background.

- Hide sidebar in fullscreen mode.
- Various tweaks to keep everything together.

All features are optional and configurable from the UI.

### Dependencies:

- **[SuperGradient](https://zen-browser.app/themes/af7ee14f-e9d4-4806-8438-c59b02b77715)** for gradient browser background.

### Operation Tips
- You must download, install and activate Sidebery on your own.
- To bring Sidebery in view or to hide again, press F1 anytime.
- Some changes, in rare cases, require you toggle Sidebery visibility or restart the browser.
- Rememeber to clear your userChrome.css entries and Sidebery style customizations if things appear broken. 
- If you manage to shrink the sidebar too much while playing with settings, you can always drag it back to original size.
- Feel free to report issues and feature requests.
