# zen-fix-sidebar-margin

A hotfix for [zen-browser/desktop#10415](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/issues/10415) until the zen team fixes that.

The only thing this does is override the redundant rule that adds a `margin-left` to the `#sidebar-box` when the tabbox is on the right side of the browser window.
