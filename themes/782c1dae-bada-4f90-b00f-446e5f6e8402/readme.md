This theme contains a few small tweaks for making the tab sidebar more compact:
- Reduce the minimum width of the sidebar while expanded
- Reduce the height of tabs

Each of these settings can be enabled individually by changing the configuration in the settings page.

Feel free to suggest more features for this theme.
