# Container Indicator

This **Zen Mod** removes the container indicator from Essentials, pinned tabs and normal tabs.

# Usage example
  - If you use the Firefox Add-on [**Facebook Container**](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/facebook-container-prevent-facebook-tracking) and have Instagram as an Essential,
    then the blue container indicator created by the Add-on might annoy you. (At least that's how it was for me.)
  - You can also remove the container indicator for pinned and normal tabs in the Zen-Mod preferences if you like.

## Settings (checkbox in Zens Mod settings):
  - Enable or disable container-indicator for Essentials (default on)
  - Enable or disable container-indicator for pinned tabs (default off)
  - Enable or disable container-indicator for normal tabs (default off)
