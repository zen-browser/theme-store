# SuperPins

This **Zen theme** elevates your experience with pinned tabs and the tab bar in general by making some UI changes, inspired by the favorites in Arc.

## What it does by default:
  - Increases the size of pinned tabs
  - Adds a background color (according to your accent color set in *Settings -> Look and Feel -> Theme Color*)
    (This can be toggled off)
  - Adds some space between the pinned tabs

## Optional Features (toggle in Zen's theme settings):
  - Stop Zen from loading all pinned tabs on startup
  - Stop Zen from dimming unloaded tabs
  - Stop Zen from decreasing opacity/greying out toolbar when Zen windows loses focus
  - Align tabs with navbar
  - Remove the border of the workspace button
  - Move workspace button to the bottom of the tabbar
  - Hide seperator line between pinned tabs and normal tabs
  - Compact mode for the pins
