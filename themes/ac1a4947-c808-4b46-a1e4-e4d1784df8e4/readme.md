# Disable Toolbar Hover

All this mod/theme does is disabling mouse-pointer events on the sidebar/toolbar, while ensuring they stay enabled for its contents.

This means, the sidebar won't expand anymore if you are in compact mode and touch the borders of your browser window with your pointer. However, you can still hover tabs for preview etc. if the sidebar/toolbar is shown e.g. via keyboard shortcuts toggling its visibility.

The same applies to configurations where e.g. the sidebar is always visible, but usually expands on hover: it will not do that anymore, but you can still hover and click elements inside the sidebar.
