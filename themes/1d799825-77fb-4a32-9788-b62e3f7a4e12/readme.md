# Thin Settings Sidebar

Collapse settings sidebar into icons only with a floating search box on smaller screens.

On screens (at least with my scaling) with width less than `820px`, the settings page had a scrollable horizontal overflow.\
For me, it was a pretty much constant state as I tend to use a two pane vertical split layout in my DE most of the time.

Took inspiration from the way Firefox handles this with the exception of a floating search bar as it better fit Zen's aesthetic.
