# Now playing indicator

Display an indicator on the 'Now playing' tab when the sidebar is collapsed. This is helpful if you've installed the 'Hide tab mute' Zen browser theme and want to quickly identify which tab is currently playing sound.

Please note that other themes may conflict with this one. If you experience any issues, please disable this theme and report the issue to the theme maintainer.
