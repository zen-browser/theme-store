# Now playing indicator

Display an indicator on the 'Now playing' tab when the sidebar is collapsed. This is helpful if you've installed the 'Hide tab mute' Zen browser theme and want to quickly identify which tab is currently playing sound.

**In version 1.2.1:**
- Fixed issue with YT video opened in new tab and the indicator shows up, hence the video is not playing.
