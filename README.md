## Workflow Bots

We make use of GitHub Actions to automate the workflow of the themes in this repository. Here's how it works:

When creating a new theme, the bot will automatically create the files and folders needed for the theme to be added to the store. The bot will also close the issue and automatically create a pull request for the theme.

When updating a theme, the bot will automatically update the theme files and folders with the new changes. This will directly push the changes to the main branch.

> We do this to make our lives easier and to make the process of adding and updating themes more efficient. We are always open to suggestions and feedback, so feel free to open an issue if you have any!
